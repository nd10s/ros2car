This is the ROS2 Humble workspace for my version of the F1TENTH Racecar projects. My goal is to autonomously race a predetermined race track at high speeds and avoid sudden obstacles placed in the robot's path. I will use a combination of LiDAR, IMU, odometry, and likely other sensor data to find the quickest path through the course.
I also want to use this project to practice programming design practices, Python and C++ languages, learn about ROS2, and create something that will hopefilly inspire others.
