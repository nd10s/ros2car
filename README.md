This is the ROS2 Humble workspace for my version of the F1TENTH/Jetson Racecar projects. My goal is to autonomously race a predetermined race track at high speeds and avoid sudden obstacles placed in the robot's path. I will use a combination of LiDAR, IMU, odometry, and likely other sensor data to find the quickest path through the course.
I also want to use this project to practice programming design practices, Python and C languages, learn about ROS2, and create something that will hopefilly inspire other people.
One of my complaints about the aforementioned F1TENTH and Jetson Racer projects is that they aren't up to date anymore and their documentation is limited. My documentation and project notes will be thorough and up to date with the latest versions of ROS and Humble, and continuously improved on over a very long amount of time as I test different algorithms and learn more about these systems and software.
I am tracking progress on Trello, viewing link here:
